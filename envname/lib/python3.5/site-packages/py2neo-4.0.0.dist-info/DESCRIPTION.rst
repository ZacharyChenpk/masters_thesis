**Py2neo** is a client library and toolkit for working with `Neo4j <https://neo4j.com/>`_ from within `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ applications and from the command line.
The library wraps the `official driver <https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver>`_, adding support for HTTP, a higher level API, an OGM, admin tools, an interactive console, a Cypher lexer for Pygments and many other bells and whistles.
Unlike previous releases, Py2neo v4 no longer requires HTTP and can work entirely through Bolt.

To install the latest stable version of py2neo, simply use pip:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install py2neo

Or to install the latest bleeding edge code directly from GitHub, use:

.. code-block::

Note that code installed directly from GitHub is likely to be unstable.
Your mileage may vary.
